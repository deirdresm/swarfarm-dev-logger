# swarfarm-dev-logger

This is a local dev version of the swarfarm logger for [sw-exporter](https://github.com/Xzandro/sw-exporter) so that you can also simultaneously push to a local dev version. Useful if you're trying to test changes out on a local install.

It's a clone with different labels so you can save a second set of API keys, etc.

By default, this goes where your logging files are set to and then the plugins directory. On a Mac, this would be:

~/Deskop/Summoners War Exporter Files/plugins/swarfarm-dev-logger.js

Of course, you can set where those files go in sw-exporter's Settings UI.
